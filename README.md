# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

This project aims to predict the operational status of water pumps in Tanzania using machine learning techniques. The project is structured in a Jupyter Notebook for clear, step-by-step analysis and modeling.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore a dataset containing information about water pumps in Tanzania. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a water pump is functional, functional but needs repair, or non-functional based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by DrivenData. It includes features such as:

- Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Date of installation
- Pump type
- Water quality
- Quantity of water
- Source of water
- ... and many more.

The target variable is the `status_group` which indicates the operational status of the water pump.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections within the Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Introduction**
    - Project overview and objectives.

2. **Data Understanding**
    - Load and explore the dataset.
    - Initial data visualization and summary statistics.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Handling missing values.
    - Feature engineering.
    - Data transformation.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Detailed visualizations.
    - Insights and patterns in the data.

5. **Modeling**
    - Model selection.
    - Training and evaluating machine learning models.
    - Hyperparameter tuning.

6. **Evaluation**
    - Model performance metrics.
    - Comparison of different models.

7. **Conclusion**
    - Summary of findings.
    - Future work and improvements.
